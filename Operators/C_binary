operator in x |= 3 is a shorthand for performing a bitwise OR operation between the value of x and 3, and then storing the result back in x.

In this case, x is initially equal to 19. The binary representation of 19 is 10011. The binary representation of 3 is 11.

To perform the bitwise OR operation, the computer takes each bit of the two binary numbers and performs a logical OR operation on them. 
The result of the OR operation for each bit is then used to create a new binary number. Here's how the bitwise OR operation is performed in this case:

  10011    <-- binary representation of x (19)
| 00011    <-- binary representation of 3
-------
  10011    <-- result of the bitwise OR operation

As you can see, the result of the bitwise OR operation is the same as the original value of x. 
Therefore, after the bitwise OR operation, the value of x remains unchanged at 19.
